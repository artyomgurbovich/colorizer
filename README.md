### Description:

An app to colorize black and white images, get a color palette, and save the result to an in-app gallery. The color palette shows the primary colors of the colorized images. The in-app gallery allows you to access all colorized images.

### Services used:

- [Image Colorization API](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/colorizer)
- [Color Extraction API](https://imagga.com/solutions/color-api)

### Ways to upload an image for coloring:

- Uploading from the phone's photo gallery
- Capture with the camera (so that you don't have to access the phone's photo gallery if there is a photo nearby)
- Uploading from Files app (if an image is in the Files, not in the photo gallery)
- Uploading from a link (so you don't have to download an image to your phone)

### In-app gallery functions:

- Show colored images and their palettes
- Share one or more images
- Delete one or more images
- Sort by creation date
- Select or deselect all images
- Preview individual image
